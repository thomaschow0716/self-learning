    "\"Reached by phone, Kaggle co-founder CEO Anthony Goldbloom declined to deny that the acquisition is happening. \"\\\n",
    "\"Google itself declined 'to comment on rumors'. Kaggle, which has about half a million data scientists on its platform, \"\\\n",

    "\"The service got an early start and even though it has a few competitors like DrivenData, TopCoder and HackerRank, \"\\\n",

    "\"and 'kernels', too. On Kaggle, kernels are basically the source code for analyzing data sets and developers can \"\\\n",

    "\"Like similar competition-centric sites, Kaggle also runs a job board, too. It's unclear what Google will do with \"\\\n",
